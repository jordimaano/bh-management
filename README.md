# BOARDING HOUSE MANAGEMENT

Boarding House Management system is a system/website used to manage boarding house for both owners and boarders.

## Boarding House Owners

Owners can create an account to show upload their boarding house vacancies for other people to see. They can also track the current occupancies of their boarding house and know which rooms are vacant or not yet filled to capacity. They can also see how long the boarder are staying in their room so that they can easily calculate the fee.

## Customers

Customers/potential boarders can also create an account to see the available boarding houses listed on the website. When they found the one that they like, they can apply for that room and wait for the owner to confirm. They can also easily determine the length of their stay and calculate the due payment accurately.

Note: This is still in development stage, and there are many incomplete parts yet.
